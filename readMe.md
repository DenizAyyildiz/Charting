VALFSAN MES Application
Welcome to VALFSAN's web-based Manufacturing Execution System (MES) application. Developed entirely in-house, this dynamic platform provides real-time insights and data-driven perspectives on various aspects of the manufacturing process.

Features
OEE Reports for Costcenters & Workcenters: Dive deep into the operational efficiency of your costcenters and workcenters through detailed OEE (Overall Equipment Efficiency) reports.

Live Workcenter Monitoring: Stay updated in real-time with the performance and activities of different workcenters.

Valuation Reports: Understand the financial worth of your goods with comprehensive valuation reports.

Technical Overview
Database Connection: Seamless integration with databases through pyodbc.

Machine Communication: Our proprietary system, built entirely in-house, leverages PLC and network systems for flawless machine communication.

Data Serving: Efficient and real-time data serving is made possible through the combined capabilities of Node-RED and Maho-MQTT.

Dashboard Development: All of our interactive dashboards are crafted using the Python Dash framework, allowing for flexible, fast, and efficient data representation.

Vision
Our ultimate vision for the VALFSAN MES application is to foster seamless connections between all modules and data. This interconnected ecosystem will empower users to monitor every layer of the manufacturing process and grasp the holistic financial situation, all in real-time.
